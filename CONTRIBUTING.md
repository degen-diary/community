# Contributing to Degen Diary Feedback

Thank you for helping improve Degen Diary. This repository is for **feedback only** — it does not contain source code.

## Community norms

1. **Search first** — Check if your issue or idea already exists. If it does, upvote it with a thumbs up reaction instead of creating a duplicate.

2. **One issue, one report** — Don't bundle multiple bugs or requests into a single issue. Keep each one focused so we can track and resolve them independently.

3. **Be specific** — For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, screenshots, and your browser/device. Vague reports are hard to act on.

4. **Protect the product** — Don't share implementation details, internal architecture, or competitive intelligence you may discover while using the app. Focus on what you experience as a user.

5. **Be respectful** — Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We're all here to make trading psychology tools better. Constructive feedback is welcome; hostility is not.

## How we triage

1. New issues are labeled `status: triage` automatically.
2. Our team reviews and assigns `type`, `area`, and `priority` labels.
3. Issues with more upvotes (thumbs up) are prioritized higher.
4. When a feature ships, we label it `status: shipped` and close the issue.

## What happens to your feedback

- **Bug reports** are investigated and fixed based on severity.
- **Feature requests** are evaluated against our product roadmap.
- **UX feedback** is reviewed by our design team.

Not every request will be implemented, but every one is read and considered.
